# JavaFinalTerm3
For our final project we made a player choice game. We used JOptionPane to make the interaction with the user look as good as possible.
The program works with alot of if, else if, and else statments. We made four classes, each class sent the player a different directions based on where they wanted to go. 

Our flow Chart is here>>>>>>> https://www.draw.io/?state=%7B%22ids%22:%5B%220B2KPoUZh7NssSUVuczlBa3FoLUk%22%5D,%22action%22:%22open%22,%22userId%22:%22113480897787051888805%22%7D#G0B2KPoUZh7NssSUVuczlBa3FoLUk
